By allowing multiple servers to be consolidated on a smaller number of physical 
hosts, virtualization is widely used in computing environments of various kinds and
scales. Nevertheless, previous high availability solutions in virtualized environments
are still unable to guarantee service-continuity in case of application failure because 
they do not target the availability at the application level, but rather at the VM level.

This paper presents \xxx, an \smr system for KVM based virtualized machines, which 
efficiently replicates programs running in the virtual machines for high availability.
\xxx achieves distributed consensus at the networking level. 
Evaluation on \nprog widely used server programs (\eg, \mysql and \redis) shows 
that \xxx is easy to use and has low overhead.
