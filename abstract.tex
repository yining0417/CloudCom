% P1: driven by increasing computational demands, big data computating 
% frameworks are widely used in many areas. Lots areas face increasing 
% computational demand. But still didn't meet the latency % and fault-tolerance 
% citeria in some areas.

% P1.1: fault-tolerance. paxos may help, but didn't meet the latency 
% requirements.

% P2: we present a fast, highly-available computing platform by leveraging 
% recent advances in rdma-enabled smr systems. frameworks now automatically 
% enjoy high availability, no needed to implement reliability by themselves. 
% can also address the slow tail problem. feasibility study in two % rdma paxos 
% systems.
