Dynamic program analysis frameworks have become increasingly pervasive and 
critical because they enable a wide range of powerful analysis tools (\eg, 
reliability, profling, and logging) at runtime to improve the quality of 
software applications. However, since existing frameworks only have one actual 
execution for an application, they have to fully or partially couple the 
analysis with the execution, which frequently transfering execution states 
(\eg, accessed memory and thread interleavings) between the actual execution 
and the analysis and causes prohibitive slowdown in the actual execution. 
Worse, to reduce the portions of execution states that require transfer, many 
frameworks require significantly carving analysis tools as well as the 
frameworks themselves, which heavily trades off transparency between the 
analysis and the framework and causes only one type of analyses to be run at 
the same time.


This paper presents \xxx, an efficient and transparent framework that fully 
decouples execution and analysis by constructing multiple equavalent 
executions. To do so, \xxx leverages two techniques: state machine replication 
(SMR) and deterministic multithreading (DMT). SMR ensures that replicas running 
the same application always see the same sequence of inputs, then multiple 
analyses can run within some replicas transparently. DMT efficiently enforces 
the same thread interleavings across replicas and eliminates the need of 
transfering thread interleavings from the actual execution to analysis. 
Evaluation shows that \xxx is easy to run asynchronous analysis tools and 
has reasonable overhead.
