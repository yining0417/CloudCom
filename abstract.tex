Dynamic program analysis frameworks greatly improve software quality as
they enable a wide range of powerful analysis tools (\eg, reliability,
profiling, and logging) at runtime. However, because existing frameworks run
only one actual execution for each software application, the execution is fully
or partially coupled with an analysis tool in order to transfer execution states
(\eg, accessed memory and thread interleavings) to the analysis tool, easily
causing a prohibitive slowdown for the execution. To reduce the portions of
execution states that require transfer, many frameworks require significantly
carving analysis tools as well as the frameworks themselves. Thus, these
frameworks significantly trade off transparency with analysis tools and allow
only one type of tools to run within one execution.


This paper presents \xxx, an efficient and transparent framework that fully 
decouples execution and analysis by constructing multiple equivalent 
executions. To do so, \xxx leverages two techniques: state machine replication 
(or SMR) and deterministic multithreading (or DMT). SMR ensures that replicas 
running the same application always see the same sequence of inputs, then 
multiple analyses can run within some replicas transparently. DMT efficiently
enforces the same thread interleavings across replicas and eliminates the need
of transferring thread interleavings from the actual execution to analysis.
Evaluation shows that \xxx is easy to run two asynchronous analysis tools together and has reasonable overhead.
