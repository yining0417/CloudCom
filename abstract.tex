Nevertheless, previous approaches do not target the availability at the application 
level, but rather at the VM level, therefore service-continuity cannot be 
guaranteed in case of application failure.

This paper presents \xxx, an SMR system for KVM based virtualized machines, 
which efficiently replicates programs running in the virtual machines. 
\xxx achieves distributed consensus at the networking level of QEMU. 
Evaluation on five widely used server programs (e.g., \mysql and \redis) shows 
that \xxx is easy to use and has low overhead.
