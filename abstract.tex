By allowing multiple servers to be consolidated on a smaller number of physical 
hosts, virtualization is widely used in computing environments of various kinds and
scales. Nevertheless, previous high availability solutions in virtualized environments
are still unable to guarantee service-continuity in case of application failure because 
they do not target the availability at the application level, but rather at the VM level.

In this paper we present an high-availability (HA) solution for the applications running in 
the virtual machines. The key to achieving high availability at the application level efficiently
in our solution is to leverage an \smr system in the network layer which replicates programs 
using RDMA. Evaluation on \nprog widely used server programs (\eg, \mysql and \redis) shows that this 
solution is easy to use and has low overhead.
