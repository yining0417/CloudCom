By allowing multiple servers to be consolidated on a smaller number of physical 
hosts, virtualization is widely used in computing environments of various kinds and
scales. Nevertheless, previous works which are aimed at achieving high availability 
in virtualized environments do not target the availability at the application level, 
but rather at the VM level, therefore service-continuity cannot be guaranteed in case 
of application failure.

This paper presents \xxx, an SMR system for KVM based virtualized machines, 
which efficiently replicates programs running in the virtual machines. 
\xxx achieves distributed consensus at the networking level of QEMU. 
Evaluation on \nprog widely used server programs (\eg, \mysql and \redis) shows 
that \xxx is easy to use and has low overhead.
