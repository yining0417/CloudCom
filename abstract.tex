By allowing multiple servers to be consolidated on a smaller number of physical 
hosts, virtualization is widely used in computing environments of various kinds and
scales.

In this paper we present an high-availability (HA) solution for the applications running in 
the virtual machines. In our solution, the key to achieving high availability efficiently 
is to leverage an State Machine Replication system in the network layer which 
replicates programs using RDMA. Evaluation on \nprog widely used server programs (\eg, \mysql and 
\redis) shows that this solution is easy to use and has low overhead.
