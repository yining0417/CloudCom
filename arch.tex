Figure 2 shows \xxx's architecture. The replication logic is entirely 
implemented in qemu-kvm, a KVM tailored version of QEMU. It contains 
four main components: a \paxos consensus protocol for input coordination, 
an output checking protocol, a circular in-memory consensus log, and a 
guard process that handles checkpointing and recovering a server's process 
state and file system state.

% On sending a packet, QEMU calls tap_receive()
% We maintain a packet queue to capture outgoing packets.
