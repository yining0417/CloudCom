Figure 2 shows \xxx's architecture. The replication logic is entirely 
implemented in qemu-kvm, a KVM tailored version of QEMU. It contains 
two main components: 
The protocol interposes on \tapsend on receiving a network packet and runs 
a consensus process on this request. Besides, this component maintains a 
packet queue to capture outgoing packets by interposing on \taprecv and invokes 
the output checking protocol periodically.

% On receiving a packet, QEMU calls tap_send()
% On sending a packet, QEMU calls tap_receive()
% We maintain a packet queue to capture outgoing packets.
