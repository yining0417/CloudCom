\section{Design of Architecture} \label{sec:overview}

Figure 2 shows our proposed architecture in KVM virtualized environment. 
It contains two main components: the Serviceguard, a tailored version 
of QEMU, and the \smr system \smrsystem .

The Serviceguard is deployed on the virtual machine, and provides monitoring 
capabilities for a configured application running on the virtual machine.
