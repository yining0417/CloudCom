\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

We have presentd the design of \xxx, the first cluster management system design 
that automatically provides high-availability to general applications. \xxx 
leverages an RDMA-enabled \paxos implementation to efficiently agree on task 
requests for critical applications across its controllers, and it replicates the 
same tasks to make these tasks highly availabile. \xxx also presents a design 
on achieving tail-tolerance with its fault-tolerance architecture. Initial 
evaluation shows that \xxx's procol has reasonable overhead, which may be 
suitable for critical application with short response time requirements. 

% We have presented \xxx, an efficient, transparent dynamic program analysis 
% framework. It leverages the transparent state machine replication technique to construct multiple equivalent 
% executions in replicas, so that actual executions and analyses can be fully 
% decoupled. Evaluation shows that \xxx can transparently run analyses on 
% replicas with reasonable overhead. Furthermore, analyses and \xxx can be 
% mutually beneficial. \xxx has the potential to promote the deployments of 
% powerful analyses in applications' production runs.
