\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

% We have presented \xxx, an efficient, transparent dynamic program analysis 
% framework. It leverages the transparent state machine replication technique to construct multiple equivalent 
% executions in replicas, so that actual executions and analyses can be fully 
% decoupled. Evaluation shows that \xxx can transparently run analyses on 
% replicas with reasonable overhead. Furthermore, analyses and \xxx can be 
% mutually beneficial. \xxx has the potential to promote the deployments of 
% powerful analyses in applications' production runs.
