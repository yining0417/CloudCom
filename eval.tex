We evaluated \xxx on \clamav, an anti-virus scanning server that scans files 
parallely and deletes malicious ones. Our evaluation was done on a set of three 
Linux 3.2.14 machines within a 1Gbps bandwidth LAN, and each machine has 2.80 
GHz dual-socket hex-core Intel Xeon with 24 hyper-threading cores and 64GB 
memory. we used \clamav's own client utility \v{clamdscan} to request the server 
to parallely scan \clamav's own source code and installation directories. we 
measured each workload's response time because it has direct impact on users.
