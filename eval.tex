% We evaluated an anti-virus scanning server that a b c d e f.

We evaluated \xxx on \clamav, an anti-virus scanning server that scans files 
parallely and deletes malicious ones.

Our evaluation was done on a set of three Linux 3.2.14 machines within a 1Gbps 
bandwidth LAN, and each machine has 2.80 GHz dual-socket hex-core Intel Xeon 
with 24 hyper-threading cores and 64GB memory. we used \clamav's own client 
utility \v{clamdscan} to request the server to parallely scan \clamav's own 
source code and installation directories. we measured each workload's 
response time because it has direct impact on users.
