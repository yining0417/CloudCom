\section{Serviceguard} \label{sec:guard}

The Serviceguard is installed on the virtual machine, and monitors the overall health of 
the configured applications. It conveys the application health status to \smrsystem in the 
form of a heartbeat via a private VLAN. If \smrsystem does not receive the heartbeat within 
a specified interval on the leader node, it will stop sending heartbeat to the other nodes  
and a leader election starts. The new leader will take over serving client requests.
