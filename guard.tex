\section{Serviceguard} \label{sec:guard}

The Serviceguard is installed on the virtual machine, and provides high availability to
a configured application running on the virtual machine. It conveys the application 
health status to \smrsystem in the form of a heartbeat via a private VLAN. If \smrsystem 
does not receive the heartbeat within a specified interval, it starts the leader election 
process.
