\subsection{Syscall interception in Xen Hypervisor}\label{sec:interception}
In order to intercept syscalls within the Xen Hypervisor itself, the first thing to 
do is to disable the Direct Trap optimization that allows the syscalls to bypass the 
hypervisor. Thus, syscalls are forced through the hypervisor and we will be able to 
catch them.
