\section{Input Consensus} \label{sec:input}

In order to provide the server programs running inside the virtual machine the exact same 
inputs in the same order, we interpose on the \tapsend function in \qemu and invoke the 
\paxos consensus component of \smrsystem on the received networking packets. Once the 
consensus process is finished, \qemu continues with its normal execution.
