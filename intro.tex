P1: Vrtualization is good:
Server consolidation
	various applications run in VMs, and multiple VMs consolidated in single physical server

P2: Fult-tolerance is important:
	server consolidation exacerbates the consequence of unexpected host failures
	failure of a single host bring down multiple VMs and all applications running on it

P3: Existing approach to fault-tolerance:
Core idea: replication
	Two servers (or more)
	Each replica keeps state needed for the service
	If one replica fails, others can continue

P4: Two main approaches for replication:
	State transfer
		“Primary” replica executes the service
		“Primary” sends [new] state to backups
	Replicated state machine (RSM)
		All replicas execute all operations
		If same start state, same operations, same order, deterministic, then same end state

P5: Limitations of each method:
	State transfer is simpler
		But state may be large, slow to transfer
	Replicated state machine (RSM) can be more efficient
		But complex to get right
			e.g. order on multi-core, determinism 

P6: Our proposal:
	A hybrid replication
		combine both “State transfer” and RSM to benefit each other

P7: Challenges:
