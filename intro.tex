\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

% P1: lots of applications require various big data frameworks. Trading, fraud 
% detection, aviation, medical, military. But existing systems can not meet the 
% high latency and availability requriements of these applications.

% P2: SMR a promising approach, but slow.
State machine replication~\cite{paxos}.

% P3: RDMA, new opportunity. Two RDMA systems.

% P4: We present a new fast, highly-available computing platform by building a 
% eco system with Mesos and RDMA SMR systems.

% Benefits.

% P5: Applications enjoy better latency and fault-tolerance.

% P6: Benefit, now frameworks can focus on their own logic, no longer need 
% fault-toelrance module. Fault-tolerance requires expert knowledge, really 
% hard to build.

% P7: Can also address the performance problem: slow tail.

% P8: Feasibility study.

% P9: rest of the paper.
