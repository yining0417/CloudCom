\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

\emph{State machine replication (\smr)} is a powerful fault-tolerance
concept.  It models a program as a deterministic state machine, where
states are important program data and the transitions are deterministic
executions of program code under input requests.  \smr runs replicas of
this state machine on multiple nodes, tolerating many possible node and
network failures.  To keep the replicas consistent, it invokes a
distributed consensus protocol (typically \paxos~\cite{paxos}) to ensure
that a quorum (typically majority) of the replicas agree on the input
request sequence; under the deterministic execution assumption, this
quorum of replicas must reach the same exact state.  \smr is proven safe
in theory, and provides high availability in practice.
